## Comparing Viruses Worms And Trojans

### Worms
- A worm virus is a virus that can spread itself through a computer network. It works by replicating itself and using a machines network and CPU proces ability. IN 2001 a worm called COde Red made headlines where it was predicted that if it was not stopped it would have ground the internet to a halt.

### Virus
- I am not defining this, if you are reading this you shuould probably just know.

### Trojan
- Similar to the famous trojan hourse attack, the virus poses as a different tools which you download. While there is malicous code hidden within which can corrupt your machine.

## Malware Payloads

In general the various malware payloads have been well named, as a result the clue is in the name as to what each piece can do.

- **Adware** \
May appear as the least harmful as it is effectively showing ads which the user may not want to see. Normally a sign that something else may be wrong. But often results in the default searche ngine to change.

- **Spyware**\
COllects information on a certain user without the users consent which can result in Identitfy theft etc. This can be done by monitoring a users keystrokes.

- **Ransomware**\
Effectively encrypts a users informaiton and holds the user or organization at ransom, after which they will un encrypt the data allowing them to use there machine again.

- **Crytpomalware**\
 Causes a machine to start mining for crytpto with out the end user knowing such an action is taking place.

## Backdoors and Logic

### Back doors
Back door are mechanisms which may be added to certain products to enable access for different means. For example some endpoint may expose a back door to enable testing. These can be used for malicous attacks. ANother example is a default password which can be used if a user has not updated from the default password.

### Logic Bombs
Logic bombs can either be caused by a time triggered function or an API call which effectively triggers some alicous code which is then executed on the system.

## Advanced Malware
Advanced malware can be deemed advanced either for the level of damage caused or by the difficulty in detecting such malware.

- **RootKit**\
Root Kit name is derived from the root access level in Linux. Root kits attempt to conceal there own presence or another piece of malware. Root kits can basically update the privilege it has on the PC.

Some root kits run in the kernel they attempt to discuise them self as drivers. Kernel mode root kits appear to be part of the OS itself.

## Botnets
Botnets are a collection of machines which have all been comprimised with the aim of causing a malicous attack against various entities. These machines act like zombies and lie dormint until they are required.

- Deliver Spam
- DDOS
- Mining Bitcoin

## Malicous Script Execution
- Shell scripts used at the OS level: bash, powershell etc

- Application Scripts
Run within a software application: Python, C# etc

### Programming Languages to know for exam (Just know what they can do)
1. Bash
2. PowerShell
3. Python
4. VBA 
5. Macros



## Understanding Adversaries
While a common view is that all attacks come from external sources, 50% of breached companies have had an internal source initiate or leak key informaiton used for the attack.

### Example Adversaies
1. Script Kiddies
2. Hactivists
3. Organized Crime
4. Corporate espionage
5. Nation State
